**Today's Progress**: Took a refresher in git so I can push this very fork. Worked on my school coding homework (A product calculator), which I did in Java. Lastly got my WordPress Blog up and running.  
**Thoughts** I have been coding for a year and a half, but something still fills missing. I started 100 days of code to be my sort of pseudo blog to look back on. I hope these anxious feelings of my future subsides. My homework took about 2 hours to complete for the pseudo code and writing Java code, is that normal? I am always wondering if I am being efficient. It has been a little while since I wrote Java code so had to refresh my memory a little on that as well.

### Day 2: October 09, Tuesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting better at css positioning (Absolutes and Relative), I made a Flow Chart. Learned AWS for hosting a static coming soon landing page (JewishDecorating.com), which I also completed today.  
**Thoughts** I am super glad to finally have actually built a project that wasn’t hosted on Codepen or Github through AWS. I am still having trouble with subdomain on aws though I hope to clear up by the end of “my night” (It is super weird that I can’t get the www.jewishdecorating.com to work, but JewishDecorating.com works*SIGH*). I got to work on TeamTreeHouse for positioning and then made some of my own tests to reinforce it. It was the first time I feel like I understand a good degree of positioning and how much help a position relative wrapper, with an absolute element can be so fun and interesting to work with. I need to get better at writing pseudo code (for Java) and conceptualizing layouts.

### Day 3: October 10, Wednesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on more Html/CSS. Started a new website project (a movie fan page) to practice on for the next couple of days or weeks (who knows “If I use it I won’t lose it right? “). I revisited positioning on TeamTreeHouse. Lastly worked on Java pseudo code writing.  
**Thoughts** I am purposely taking my time on html and css. All my responsive page projects on Free Code Camp are done, but I don’t quite want to move ahead yet. I Started a new website project (a movie fan page). Thinking about when I want to start using and learning JavaScript again. I just don’t want to rush anything. I am really taking my time and trying to slow my brain down. I also started writing extra detailed pseudo code to help me think through things before I jump into coding (Mainly on my java school work). I wish I knew what “job ready” really means. Will I ever not feel nervous before I start a project? I always think I am doing it wrong, I keep doubting everything wondering if I am using the best practices. I just don’t want to make bad habits. I wonder if it’s normal if I am always nervous before I put a div down, or maybe it should be a span, maybe it doesn’t need either?!?:/(confusion I call this). I think I will start responsive layouts team tree house, tomorrow.


### Day 4: October 11, Thursday 2018

**Today's Progress**: I Worked on my new movie fan page, lots of hours trying to center an image with the nav bar text to be centered (without flex or grid), is this normal?.

**Thoughts** It was a really tough day. I thought I knew enough to control my css positioning elements, but I just couldn’t get the nav bar and logo image aligned correctly on a header. I tried many different solutions, but nothing was working properly. It was a very discouraging day honestly. I keep getting stuck in positioning things with css and also being responsive. So instead of moving on today I continued my work with positioning. I am continuing to keep working on it until I really can get things working to have the most responsive layouts, with the most basic css code. I could of used flex, but I really wanted to solve it a different way.  I want to truly understand why and when positions work the way that they do, and fully be able to explain it well to others. For now I ended up just using absolute positioning, I am sure there is probably a better way to do it. I think it has something to do with vertical align middle, but it just wasn’t working for me. Feel free to take a look at the code below and find a better solution without flexbox or grids.

### Day 5: October 12, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: I Worked on my movie fan page some more(sneak peak image on blog). Worked on making a footer stick to the bottom of the screen mainly today.
**Thoughts** It was a little of a battle getting the footer to stick to the bottom of the page properly, without being fixed all the time. The article below helped me out to understand better. I did handle the battle today, better then yesterday. I contribute that to wanting to cook for the Sabbath. I will tweak more of this fan site design, and decide if I want to go into JavaScript yet. I might do one or two more html/css projects. While writing this I do think I might just stick with another week of just html/css properties. I do believe I am getting familiar with it and I want to keep it that way.

### Day 6: October 13, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**: Today I worked mainly on my coding HW(I paid extra attention to my pseudo code). I also went to a coding meetup. Maybe got 30 min of CSS done as well.  

**Thoughts** I felt good about going to the meetup today. Seeing peoples work and just being around like minded people is really helpful mentally.  I am super happy to also say goodbye to the Raptor program school was having us use to code, and we can start using Python.  Today I also was reminiscing and sad that I kind of gave up on my Android development, months ago in favor of web development, being the probability of an entry level job is more likely with web development. **I wonder if I should try to code a small project in it again? Hmm I might have to let this one go for now and not take on any more things though. ** Time to start Python coding.

### Day 7: October 14, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today I put a lot of hours into more CSS positioning which was a failure, although I don’t say this ever a “successful failure”. I still think I might just stick with CSS for a week more before I move on to new things, other than school Python work.
**Thoughts** I got to have some good conversations on Discord about some absolute positioning rules, and other little bits of information in the coding world.  It was good to see I am not the only one taking 4 hours to figure out how to make a certain positioning work even for professionals. We pretty much came to a result of absolute positioning is just not going to work in some type of container to center it, without manually setting margins or widths. Especially to be responsive as well.  You can see my “absolute failure” NOT centered in the black below. I do think I got a way better idea of absolute positioning and its limitations. There is still much to learn on it, but I think I will move on from trying to force it to center 8 absolute items in a wrapper and thinking it will come out pretty.

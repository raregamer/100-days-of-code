# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 08, Monday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Took a refresher in git so I can push this very fork. Worked on my school coding homework (A product calculator), which I did in Java. Lastly got my WordPress Blog up and running.  
**Thoughts** I have been coding for a year and a half, but something still fills missing. I started 100 days of code to be my sort of pseudo blog to look back on. I hope these anxious feelings of my future subsides. My homework took about 2 hours to complete for the pseudo code and writing Java code, is that normal? I am always wondering if I am being efficient. It has been a little while since I wrote Java code so had to refresh my memory a little on that as well.

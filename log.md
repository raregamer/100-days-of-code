### Day 1: October 08, Monday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Took a refresher in git so I can push this very fork. Worked on my school coding homework (A product calculator), which I did in Java. Lastly got my WordPress Blog up and running.  
**Thoughts** I have been coding for a year and a half, but something still fills missing. I started 100 days of code to be my sort of pseudo blog to look back on. I hope these anxious feelings of my future subsides. My homework took about 2 hours to complete for the pseudo code and writing Java code, is that normal? I am always wondering if I am being efficient. It has been a little while since I wrote Java code so had to refresh my memory a little on that as well.

### Day 2: October 09, Tuesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting better at css positioning (Absolutes and Relative), I made a Flow Chart. Learned AWS for hosting a static coming soon landing page (JewishDecorating.com), which I also completed today.  
**Thoughts** I am super glad to finally have actually built a project that wasn’t hosted on Codepen or Github through AWS. I am still having trouble with subdomain on aws though I hope to clear up by the end of “my night” (It is super weird that I can’t get the www.jewishdecorating.com to work, but JewishDecorating.com works*SIGH*). I got to work on TeamTreeHouse for positioning and then made some of my own tests to reinforce it. It was the first time I feel like I understand a good degree of positioning and how much help a position relative wrapper, with an absolute element can be so fun and interesting to work with. I need to get better at writing pseudo code (for Java) and conceptualizing layouts.

### Day 3: October 10, Wednesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on more Html/CSS. Started a new website project (a movie fan page) to practice on for the next couple of days or weeks (who knows “If I use it I won’t lose it right? “). I revisited positioning on TeamTreeHouse. Lastly worked on Java pseudo code writing.  
**Thoughts** I am purposely taking my time on html and css. All my responsive page projects on Free Code Camp are done, but I don’t quite want to move ahead yet. I Started a new website project (a movie fan page). Thinking about when I want to start using and learning JavaScript again. I just don’t want to rush anything. I am really taking my time and trying to slow my brain down. I also started writing extra detailed pseudo code to help me think through things before I jump into coding (Mainly on my java school work). I wish I knew what “job ready” really means. Will I ever not feel nervous before I start a project? I always think I am doing it wrong, I keep doubting everything wondering if I am using the best practices. I just don’t want to make bad habits. I wonder if it’s normal if I am always nervous before I put a div down, or maybe it should be a span, maybe it doesn’t need either?!?:/(confusion I call this). I think I will start responsive layouts team tree house, tomorrow.


### Day 4: October 11, Thursday 2018

**Today's Progress**: I Worked on my new movie fan page, lots of hours trying to center an image with the nav bar text to be centered (without flex or grid), is this normal?.

**Thoughts** It was a really tough day. I thought I knew enough to control my css positioning elements, but I just couldn’t get the nav bar and logo image aligned correctly on a header. I tried many different solutions, but nothing was working properly. It was a very discouraging day honestly. I keep getting stuck in positioning things with css and also being responsive. So instead of moving on today I continued my work with positioning. I am continuing to keep working on it until I really can get things working to have the most responsive layouts, with the most basic css code. I could of used flex, but I really wanted to solve it a different way.  I want to truly understand why and when positions work the way that they do, and fully be able to explain it well to others. For now I ended up just using absolute positioning, I am sure there is probably a better way to do it. I think it has something to do with vertical align middle, but it just wasn’t working for me. Feel free to take a look at the code below and find a better solution without flexbox or grids.

### Day 5: October 12, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: I Worked on my movie fan page some more(sneak peak image on blog). Worked on making a footer stick to the bottom of the screen mainly today.
**Thoughts** It was a little of a battle getting the footer to stick to the bottom of the page properly, without being fixed all the time. The article below helped me out to understand better. I did handle the battle today, better then yesterday. I contribute that to wanting to cook for the Sabbath. I will tweak more of this fan site design, and decide if I want to go into JavaScript yet. I might do one or two more html/css projects. While writing this I do think I might just stick with another week of just html/css properties. I do believe I am getting familiar with it and I want to keep it that way.

### Day 6: October 13, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**: Today I worked mainly on my coding HW(I paid extra attention to my pseudo code). I also went to a coding meetup. Maybe got 30 min of CSS done as well.  

**Thoughts** I felt good about going to the meetup today. Seeing peoples work and just being around like minded people is really helpful mentally.  I am super happy to also say goodbye to the Raptor program school was having us use to code, and we can start using Python.  Today I also was reminiscing and sad that I kind of gave up on my Android development, months ago in favor of web development, being the probability of an entry level job is more likely with web development. **I wonder if I should try to code a small project in it again? Hmm I might have to let this one go for now and not take on any more things though. ** Time to start Python coding.

### Day 7: October 14, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today I put a lot of hours into more CSS positioning which was a failure, although I don’t say this ever a “successful failure”. I still think I might just stick with CSS for a week more before I move on to new things, other than school Python work.
**Thoughts** I got to have some good conversations on Discord about some absolute positioning rules, and other little bits of information in the coding world.  It was good to see I am not the only one taking 4 hours to figure out how to make a certain positioning work even for professionals. We pretty much came to a result of absolute positioning is just not going to work in some type of container to center it, without manually setting margins or widths. Especially to be responsive as well.  You can see my “absolute failure” NOT centered in the black below. I do think I got a way better idea of absolute positioning and its limitations. There is still much to learn on it, but I think I will move on from trying to force it to center 8 absolute items in a wrapper and thinking it will come out pretty.

### Day 8: October 15, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today was all about making a new page layout. I wanted to use only floats to make the grid. Thankfully it actually did work. I was also able to make it responsive with flex fairly simply (for a change)!
**Thoughts**  Today was a nice change, being I was able to implement a grid way easier than I thought it would be, using only floats. I had a couple of small issues (Which is totally normal and expected), but I was able to fix them pretty easily by myself. I thought I was going to just cave in and end up using a css grid, since I had so much trouble with the banner (on the American Pie home page) with absolute values. Though the floats worked the way I expected them to, getting centered and being responsive with flex. On a side note my regards to Paul Allen today. It is always sad to hear about and see the people that inspired me and gave me a sense of curiosity to do more pass away.

### Day 9: October 16, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today I worked on making my movie trailer page, which worked out well. I also started to introduce myself to Python and in school we started using and coding with it as well. I do prefer Java as of now, since that is what I originally learned how to code with.
**Thoughts** Today was pretty basic as far as things, watched the Derek Bananas video for Python. I worked on my American Pie movie trailer page. Not too much to report I wish I would have coded more today, but I had a lot of extra things to do today and I think I need some goodnight sleep. 

### Day 10: October 17, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Really tough, python killed me, really my hw more so. Python just is weird the way they don’t have brackets. I spent 4 hours somehow on making a, which number is bigger (more info below).

**Thoughts**

How do you get better at pseudo code? It’s really killing me. I didn't realize how bad I thought in programming terms, until I started my college class. I can't seem to write proper pseudo code. The only way I know how to code is by coding, then whatever is broken fix it. I just somehow spent 4 hours on making a which number is bigger between 3 numbers, in python in various ways, because I never thought of the possibility of 2 of the 3 numbers being equal and 1 being greater or less than. I might understand programming, but I don't think like a programmer yet.


### Day 11: October 18, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	I took kind of a chill day today, since yesterday hurt so much. I did some python coding homework. I also finished some loose ends on my #freecodecamp curriculum to get my Responsive Web Design Certification. 

**Thoughts** 
	Thankfully my python homework didn’t hurt me today, but I definitely felt a lot of “Imposter Syndrome” I worked on the accessibility track on free code camp to finish out my Responsive Web Design certification. I for some reason just kind of skipped over it originally, so it has been on my to do list. Today was the perfect day for that because I wanted to work on some css and be directed with simple instructions.  

### Day 12: October 19, Friday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

I worked on my Python homework for about an hour and half. Python has not been fun to learn after learning Java. I didn’t have as much time today to code as I would’ve liked.

 

**Thoughts**

Python is getting to be a little strange. I am not sure I like how I declare variables. It is kind of like JavaScript to me. I had a lot of trouble today with checking if a value is an int and I am still working on understanding it.

### Day 13: October 20, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Started some more CSS responsive design with Team Tree House. Worked on finishing my Python homework.   



**Thoughts**

            I learned Python really likes try blocks for data type verification of user inputs. I spend 4 hours on a homework that I could of finished in 10 minutes if I didn't overthink the question/problem. I need to stop over thinking things which seems to be a constant in every aspect of my life. I have so much to learn, yet I always feel like the door is closing.

### Day 14: October 21, Sunday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            It was hard getting to code today, I was busy up until 10pm. I just got an hour in, I didn’t have a plan since I was so tired. I tried to make a quick layout in CSS mimicking a magazine layout article.    



**Thoughts**

            I did get my code to work in that short time and replicate the first section of the magazine I was trying to replicate, but boy was/is it messy. It was also not as simple as I thought in my mind.  I will continue on with this idea in the future of using magazine layouts as inspiration.  Why won’t coding sink in better???



### Day 15: October 22, Monday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            I went through and practiced responsive design more. Went through the Team Tree House responsive course, and re-wrote/made comments/studied all of their html and CSS code structure to get a better understanding of how they lay it all out.

**Thoughts**

            Practiced, read more code, practiced more code. Just code, code, code. I am hoping I am studying the right way. Tomorrow I am going to go over flexbox again.  I realized Team Tree House relies a bit more on normalize css then I thought, for some basic padding stuff. Overall it was nice to see how they go about it.   

**P.S.**

I assure you that footer works correctly and doesn't float the way it does in the image.

### Day 16: October 23, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I worked on CSS flexbox and Python challenges. I decided to go through the PracticePython.org exercises, I will try to do one a day depending on how involved each one might be.

**Thoughts** 
	I am considering doing a one off day, just to go through and peek back at Android Studios and see what I can refresh my brain in. I wonder how much I retained since the last time I even opened it. I am hoping by the end of the week to have done that. I am not sure how bad it is to keep switching between so many languages. Oh well, they all at least having coding in common :).

### Day 17: October 24, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today was pretty straight forward, I worked on CSS flexbox and Python challenge 2 from #practicepython.org

**Thoughts** 
	Today’s coding was pretty simple, since I was really familiar with most of the concepts prior to today. I did get a better understanding on the flexbox grow and basis properties which was nice.

### Day 18: October 25, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Today was straight forward, I finished the TeamTreeHouse CSS flexbox course and Python challenge 3 from #practicepython.

**Thoughts**

Today’s coding was pretty much the same as yesterday, more flexbox and a Python challenge. I finished all things flexbox on teamtreehouse and everywhere else at this point. So I really hope I understand it well.

### Day 19: October 26, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I worked on some HTML/CSS Forms. I also had to skip my Python challenge, in favor/priority of Python school homework. 

**Thoughts** 
	Today was all good, I reviewed form properties in HTML and CSS. In Python I had to hold off on practicepython.org, while I did Python school work. Which might take up the next couple days. Overall I got at least an hour in, but I wish I had more time. Fridays are usually the toughest days to get code time in. 



### Day 20: October 27, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I finished the #TeamTreeHouse forms track. Today's thoughts on my site have way more info, if you want more of a write up :).

**Thoughts** 
	 Today I finished the Team Tree House forms track. I will continue to work with forms with my next step being using a back-end to actually send the information in the form to a server using Python. I didn’t do any Python coding today as of this writing sadly, but will do it again tomorrow or later in the night if I am up for it. I am starting to feel somewhat of a burnout to try and fit as much code as possible in a day. I have been hitting more than an hour of code a day, but sometime in a flow I don’t want to just switch, even though there is so much I want to get to. I do also need breaks and downtime as well, family time and normal human maintenance time. Anyhow #movingforward.


### Day 21: October 28, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I did 2 Python exercises from practicepython.org. I am struggling so much internally, #impostorsyndrome is possibly taking over me or coding is just getting really hard. 

**Thoughts** 
	Today was really hard for me to keep motivated to code, but I forced myself through it. I am hoping tomorrow goes better. I am going to start working on JavaScript again tomorrow. I hope to get more confidence in my coding. I believe internally I am struggling most with impostor syndrome and a lack of guidance right now of what I am really working towards or the technologies I need to accomplish it I want to do. I hope that in the future I can get this worked out and have some clarity. On a side note the link below is to a forum post, which was reminding me just how hard even when you have a lot of progress/work under your belt how hard getting a job later on can be.

### Day 22: October 29, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I started JavaScript again, on #FreeCodeCamp, I also did my practice Python exercise 6. 

**Thoughts** 
	Really today was mainly getting reacquainted with the JavaScript syntax. I also did the practicepython.org exercise 6. I really hope in the near future to get real life experience in coding. Everything I do is all “fun and games”, but never seems practical in a work environment. I could be wrong since I haven’t been in one yet though.

### Day 23: October 30, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Worked through more of the JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp. I also did my practice Python exercise 7.
**Thoughts**
            My Python exercise was funny, I guess I should read more carefully. When it says “write the even elements in one line”, don’t be me :) and write:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
##get the even indices :)
evenList = a[::2]
print(evenList)
 
Instead write:
evenList = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0].
 
Free Code Camp JavaScript was straight forward.  I am sure I will be doing more coding later at school tonight, but I am getting this write up out of the way since tonight I am going to the Mike Shinoda concert!

### Day 24: October 31, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Worked through more of the JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp. I am almost complete with it, should be done tomorrow with it and moving onto es6. I was a little under the weather, so it was hard getting anything done.

**Thoughts**

Today I am feeling pretty sick so I got some JavaScript in, but tomorrow hoping to be better to have more progress.




### Day 25: Nov 01, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Today I went through Objects in JavaScript. I am about done on the JavaScript portion on #FCC. I could have done more, but I wanted to sit with some of the concepts a little more, before moving on. Fast isn’t always best, I learnt the hard way.

**Thoughts**

            I thought I would have been done today, on the JavaScript portion of Free Code Camp, but I couldn’t get to it all. I can say with confidence tomorrow “it’s going down”. I am sad I haven’t done Python for two days in a row. It’s really hard getting to everything I want to get to and still have some down time. Today thankfully, I was feeling better from being sick yesterday, I should be fully recovered tomorrow.

I touched a little on JSON, going through properties and pulling them out. I want to get more confident in manipulating JSON data. Something about it always gives me a nervous feeling. It just gets so messy in the nest.


### Day 26: Nov 02, Friday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Today I finished up the JavaScript section of #FreeCodeCamp , It took way longer then I wanted, and I struggled on certain challenges, but it’s all done now : ). Now it’s time to reinforce it and move on.

**Thoughts**

The JavaScript JSON challenges broke me a little today, I spent close to 2 hours on  the “Record Collection Challenge” and the “Profile Lookup”. They aren’t even hard questions, but I just get lost in either not having the correct syntax, to pull the data I want, or I am overlooking a simple statement, that was just placed too early in the code block. The latter hurts me the most, because it continues to show when I am coding I am not following my own written program correctly in my head, which I work so hard on and struggle with constantly.

### Day 27: Nov 03, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Today I worked on my Python homework and I started to go over JavaScript concepts on #TeamTreeHouse.   

**Thoughts**

            Today, not too much to report, it was pretty much do a Python homework that added books over a period of days, that a user entered. In JavaScript, I did the Team Tree House lessons that went over JavaScript concepts using a small in browser game framework called Phaser. I did think it was a really cool way to introduce JavaScript or programming to anyone who would be starting out. It peaked my interest on the Phaser framework and I would love to use it in my own project in the future.

### Day 28: Nov 04, Sunday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:
            I had a coding exam today which took 2 hours, I didn’t even get through it all. I also did about 30 min on #TeamTreeHouse on while loops. I believe I am in a loop. #TodayWasHard, tons of info on my blog. 


**Thoughts**
            Today my exam in the morning took so much energy out of me. I thought I would be able to breeze through it, but at a point the questions became more complex and my mind became foggy, I couldn’t think clearly. I couldn’t break down questions that are actually simple. I do tend to work slowly when it comes to breaking down a question and understanding it. So when I have to read and decipher a lot of different programs/questions at once I get burnt out. So when a question gets more complex with more things to keep track of I start getting lost in the echo. 

I don’t know if I should blame myself or the fact that something about coding questions make me super unsure of myself. They are written terribly always no matter what website, class, book anything trying to teach you coding. It could’ve been because there was a 2 hour time limit, which seemed like a short time for writing 7-10 pseudo program codes and some multiple choice questions(maybe the time pressure was the point and you weren’t really supposed to get to the end). So at a certain point I was running out of time and the questions seemed like they weren’t making sense anymore and causing me to panic. I am probably just making excuses. 

Either way I felt like shit after the test, mainly because the test covered everything from variables to arrays things I went over thousands of times in the year and a half I’ve been learning to code. It brought me to my knees and made me feel like I should quit and brought in the dreaded thought” I just am not smart enough” for coding. 

Later in the day after a long day of other activities and time to unwind.  I forced myself to work on Team Tree House just to get some lighter hearted coding practice in. I am starting to wonder if I am just scared to move past the beginner stage of coding amongst other things and I keep putting myself in an infinite loop or it’s the time to say this isn’t for you. 



### Day 29: Nov 05, Monday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I finished up the loops section of the Team Tree House course. Tomorrow I will go over arrays.  No Python today. 

**Thoughts**
            I don’t have much too say, I am just plugging away coding chip by chip, and moving forward. 


### Day 30: Nov 06, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I worked on Arrays, Functions and more Loops with Team Tree House and in school. 
**Thoughts**
         I am emotionally drained and tired, getting bored of looking at the same type of fundamentals of coding. I need to breakaway and move forward from this step. 


### Day 31: Nov 07, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
Got food poisoning, but got coding in before that. I worked on Python Try/Catch Blocks and arrays.
**Thoughts**
I can’t remember since I am writing this a day later.


### Day 32: Nov 08, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            I worked on my Python homework today. Worked with some JavaScript with the DOM, and finished the Python basics course on Team Tree House. 
**Thoughts**
         I was still getting over being sick yesterday, but I was able to accomplish finishing the Python basics course on Team Tree House. I really liked how they used Trello to make it seem so easy to tackle a project. I really hope in the near future I can use a tool like that so elegantly. It made the project so manageable to do. I just need to learn how to breakdown my own problems in simple steps. 



### Day 33: Nov 09, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            I worked on a lot of objects creating and manipulating them, using arrays and loops in conjunction with the DOM. 
**Thoughts**
         Friday’s are always hectic, so I am not sure exactly how I was feeling, since I am writing this late. I usually write my Friday blog posts on a Saturday night, since I really don’t have time to write it up on Friday. 




### Day 34: Nov 10, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today, I got a lot more practice in with Objects and Arrays. I finished up the #TeamTreeHouse JavaScript Object lessons. I also worked on my Python school homework. 
**Thoughts**
         Thankfully today I feel like I got a lot done. I finished writing out all my pseudocode, on my Python homework. My homework is pretty much done, including the coding. I finished up the JavaScript Object lessons on TeamTreeHouse as well, along with all the additional practice exercises. 
I want to say I feel more confident in coding today in general and with objects, but coding is just like golf, when you think you are starting to understand/get it, you really don’t so I won’t jinx myself. Anyhow for what it’s worth, it seemed to be a successful day just on the front of how my brain felt. It was thinking clearly through the coding problems and breaking them down in a healthy formulated way.  



### Day 35: Nov 11, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I finished my Python homework. It came out quite well I believe. 
**Thoughts**
         Even though I only worked an hour today on coding. My Python homework came out well. I really took my time on breaking everything down pre-coding in my pseudo code. I think I got a little lazy in the last part when I could have made the code even cleaner with another function to display things out. I could always refactor it, but either way I think it is pretty readable for anyone. On a side note coming from Java and JavaScript, one thing that confuses me a little in Python is the syntax on “for loops”. Although it makes it up, with how easy it is to get through an array. 


### Day 36: Nov 12, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I worked with the document object in JavaScript. Using it to manipulate and add interactivity with CSS elements on the HTML page.  
**Thoughts**
         Not much to talk about just got a pretty high overview today and worked with some selectors in the DOM. Thankfully it was all pretty straight forward, using pretty standard methods. I got familiar with event listeners when I was learning Android development in the past. 



### Day 37: Nov 13, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I practiced more with manipulating elements/nodes(whatever you want to call it) in the DOM.   
**Thoughts**
         Today I used the DOM to add and remove elements from the HTML page. I am getting a little bored with all the lessons I am taking. After I finish this section I am going to find a project to work on for a couple days. I am going to build a static site again maybe using some JavaScript I learned. 
It has been a while since my last project using CSS, and I want to revisit what I learned prior and still be sharp with it. One hard thing about programming is there are so many moving pieces, but I want to stay sharp on older concepts. Though I am not using them every day on projects. How can you stay sharp if you are trying to learn other concepts also? (I am going to ask this on Reddit now that I am thinking about it so much.)


### Day 38: Nov 14, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I did a practice on DOM Manipulation. Worked on some python HW, building functions. Lastly I started to go through making a To Do List. I do feel a little bit like an impostor with the To Do List since I am using an instructional video to help me along.    
**Thoughts**
         I felt the Imposter Syndrome today. It was ticked on when watching part of the To Do List app video I am building. The guy just flies by and I just wish I can understand what I need to do that fast, will I ever be there, etc…,etc… thoughts in a vortex. 
These task wouldn’t be so unsettling if I was reading instructions not watching someone seem like it’s so simple. I do pause the video often before he starts building and give myself time to figure it out myself, then see how he did it. A lot of times I know what to do, but I just have trouble implementing them. Mainly this happens with the CSS, it drives me crazy, trying to get everything aligning up properly. 
	Moving on Python was simple for now. And my DOM Practice had some challenges, but I was able to figure it all out. One property I couldn’t remember which type it was I was looking for, to call the method. Ironically enough it was “element.type”.

### Day 39: Nov 15, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I worked on my To Do List in JavaScript. 
**Thoughts**
        I didn’t work nearly enough today, because I really just didn’t want to. I wasn’t having a good day. I forced myself to code and I implemented adding notes to a list using the DOM. I couldn’t get any further that, my head was just not interested in working at all today. 


### Day 40: Nov 16, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Tomorrow I need to do way better. I worked a little on the To Do List, but wow was I lacking. 
**Thoughts**
        Impostor syndrome is taking its toll on me. Mixed with I realize I am fine with programming, but when it comes to CSS stuff, please give me anything, but that. I will continue to work on it, but it is really discouraging me from programming.. 



### Day 41: Nov 17, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            I finished the To Do List APP, I also finished my latest Python homework. 
**Thoughts**
        Impostor syndrome is still taking a toll on me. It flares up more I realized, when I watch YouTube videos of people coding. I am going to stick to very specific Team Tree House videos or books from now on. Finishing up the To Do List video on YouTube really wasn’t easy for me to processes. I did finish it, but I also ended up cheating in the end on the CSS Pseudo selectors, by just copying and pasting it. I was just getting sick of watching someone fly through CSS coding like it was a breeze.

### Day 42: Nov 18, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            I worked on a new section of manipulating the DOM with interactions on Team Tree House
**Thoughts**
      I was really tired today, and I took it pretty easy on coding. I feel like I might be going into a burnout stage. So I started to slow down on my coding today and recharge. Though I did feel pretty guilty for not coding more. Tomorrow is a new day.  


### Day 43: Nov 19, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Finished the traversing the DOM course on Team Tree House. 
**Thoughts**
      I finished up working with selectors and manipulating the DOM in JavaScript. I look forward to doing the practice exercise, then moving back to Free Code Camp and also more Python. I am honestly sick of watching videos. I much rather read directions and instructions then a video presentation. I do like answers in video format just not the instructions.  


### Day 44: Nov 20, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           I worked on practicing traversing the DOM. I also worked on more Python.
**Thoughts**
      Writing this late due to a long day. I did the Team Tree House practice session for traversing the DOM. I also worked on Python arrays a little in class. 


### Day 45: Nov 21, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Today I started the #FreeCodeCamp ES6 in JavaScript section. 
**Thoughts**
      I started the ES6 section on Free Code Camp. I really enjoyed working on a problem that used arrow functions (I will post the question and my solution below). Mainly I enjoyed it because I understood how to breakdown the problem. Then look up the MDN documentation, and the best part was I actually understood what I was searching for and how to read the documentation. I think I finally can say I am getting a tad better at reading official documentation, which is super important in programming. 

FCC Instructions:  
“Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) in the array realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.”

My Solution: 
	const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2];
	const squareList = (arr) => {
	  "use strict";

	  // change code below this line
	 // my Solution
	  const squaredIntegers = arr.filter(arr => Number.isInteger(arr) && arr >= 0).map(x =>  x * x); 
	  // change code above this line
	  return squaredIntegers;
	};
	// test your code
	const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
	console.log(squaredIntegers);



### Day 46: Nov 22, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
Today I worked on some more ES6, and for fun and practice I am going through CSS Diner.
**Thoughts**
      I started going through CSS Diner, I am a little more than halfway through the ES6 section on Free Code Camp. I am having some personal problems that is making for a really tough time. Coding with a clear state of mind has short windows. Though I keep pounding through, hopefully I can reach a break through soon.

### Day 47: Nov 23, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
Today I worked on some more ES6, and finished CSS Diner
**Thoughts**
      CSS Diner was a fun interesting way to go through Selectors. I think it did show me a few new neat tricks. I love the way they presented it. 
**Links**

### Day 48: Nov 24, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
Today I worked on more of the ES6 section from Free Code Camp. I should be done by tomorrow. Then I want to map out some ideas to build something, it has been too long.  
**Thoughts**
      I am about done with the ES6 section from Free Code Camp. I did have some struggle on one of the problems, mainly because I couldn’t remember what function to use to split an array up. It happened to be .map(). I had to use a hint from Free Code Camp. One big struggle is it’s so hard to know when you’re coding what you’re even looking for, or how to explain what I am trying to do. I really need to get better with that and not getting so nervous when I don’t know. I wish I knew how people learned that skill. 



### Day 49: Nov 25, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
Today I finished up the ES6 section on Free Code Camp and worked on my Python HW.
**Thoughts**
      I finished up the ES6 section on #FCC. I also finished up the Pseudo Code for my Python HW, and I am going to start coding it up now. It might take a couple days to finish coding. It is a long problem, with writing and reading to files.


### Day 50: Nov 26, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	I’ve been working on my Python homework today which, is a lot of reading and writing to files. 
**Thoughts**
      I worked for a little more than an hour for now on my Python homework today. I am getting as much coding in as I can these days. The holidays and my job, have been taking a lot of my time up. Which is handicapping me to work freely, and with a clear mind set for coding. Though I think about 2 hours after my work ends and dinner is done, I get enough clarity to progress on my coding journey for at least a couple of hours, before I am burnt out. 


### Day 51: Nov 27, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I worked on more reading and writing files in Python. I also had to write in class a shopping cart application in pseudo code.
**Thoughts**
      I am getting to feel more comfortable in my coding skills. Although in school I had to write a pseudo code application on the spot, and I had to take several deep breaths before I started, to code in a calm manor. It took me probably 15 minutes to settle myself down and not be so nervous about coding and start working on the problem properly. Man do I hope that feeling goes away somehow (I hate being nervous and for really no reason. Honestly what is the worst that can happen from coding? Your code doesn’t work and you just have to fix it.(well if it was broken code in an important company that can be a problem, but I am not quite there yet :) ).   


### Day 52: Nov 28, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I been working on finishing up my homework. Hopefully it needs only another hour or two. I am working on building a function that process employee data, calculates some of the data and writes it to a document.
**Thoughts**
      Formatting in coding is really a nuisance.   



### Day 53: Nov 29, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            I finished my Python HW today, it had a lot of parts, so it took me a couple days. Now I am on to the next and final HW assignment.

**Thoughts**

      Did you know that a .write() method only accepts one argument? Well I do :). Anyhow everything went as well as I can expect today. Looking forward to finishing up my last homework that I will probably start this weekend.     



### Day 54: Nov 30, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I started my final Python HW. Finished out all the pseudo code, and briefly started coding it up.  
**Thoughts**
      	Not much to say, tomorrow I will working on finishing up the final HW assignment.  


### Day 55: Dec. 1, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	I worked on my final Python HW project, it is almost done. I just need to add some conditional statements. I also worked on some #hourOfCode activities, since I will be volunteering this week. 
**Thoughts**
I spent close to a little over an hour and half, working on two functions that print out a table, based on a user criteria and laid out the ground work for the finishing touches of my final home work. 
On the Hour of Code activities, I wanted to familiarize myself a little with the platform, before I volunteered, so I checked out some cool projects they have. I tried a Star Wars one moving BB8 around. A video overlay for news programming. Lastly a mobile app that was showing how event listeners and other elements work.  I am very impressed overall with the initiative of this program and loved how they do it. It is almost a pre-cursor to freecodecamp.com and I only wish I grew up with things like this, and tried it sooner.

### Day 56: Dec. 2, Sunday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            I worked on my final Python HW project, I still have a few more finishing touches, since I like to overthink things and keep trying out different coding solutions. I #loveToDelayFinishing, I #shouldBeDone, though I am #laughingAtMySelf and having #fun at the same time so it's all good. Anyhow moving on RELAX time SLEEPzzzTime.  :) 

**Thoughts**

                Tired, Tired, Tired…Overall AOK.


### Day 57: Dec. 3, Monday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            I finished my last Python HW for the semester. I also started the #freecodecamp regex course.

**Thoughts**

 I am thinking about what project I should work on next since my Python class for the semester is done tomorrow, I’ll be on break for the next couple weeks. So besides working on Free Code Camp, I want to get my own project started. I really need to brainstorm. I am also starting to tidy my resume, so I can apply for internships in the summer.


### Day 58: Dec. 4, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Day 58 I had my Python final today.
**Thoughts**
	I had my Python final today, everything was going well until my final problem. I had to just have a password meet conditions.  Even that went well for the first part. Until it came to verifying the password, the conditional system was easily fool able. I was having trouble with scoping as well when it came to Python for a while. I later found out a better solution would be to use regular expressions, but in the moment it didn’t even occur to me, which is funny, because that is what I am learning on my own currently, granted in JavaScript, but the concepts remain the same. So I do plan to redo that final question in the next day or so in a proper way, being I didn’t like how my final solution came out.  


### Day 59: Dec. 5, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           I got to volunteer at the Hour of Code event today! I also worked on regular expressions in JavaScript (Regex) on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts**
	I am not going to lie, at the time of this writing, I have only done 30 minutes of code today, but I plan on making up the other 30 min before I go to sleep, and hopefully more. It was just a busy day. I volunteered at the Hour of Code event today which was really fun to do. I hope to be a part of it again next year. I believe the kids really enjoyed it, and I enjoyed helping and watching them play the Hour of Code games, which was the Grinch and a dance one. Hour of Code is an awesome program for kids and really anyone. 


### Day 60: Dec. 6, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

           I worked on more Regex in JavaScript. I used some regex as well on my Python password validation code.

**Thoughts**

            I think today went well I worked on my Free Code Camp regex section which should be done by tomorrow. I also built out a small Python password validator which was an assignment for school that I wanted to redo with regex.

**Code**

	import re

	##Check password function

	def isValidPassword(enteredPassword):

	lengthCheck = False

	if(len(enteredPassword) >= 6 and len(enteredPassword) <= 16):

	lengthCheck = True

	else:

	lengthCheck = False


	## check for letters

	letterCheck = False

	alpha = re.compile('[a-z]+',re.I)

	if(alpha.search(enteredPassword)):

	letterCheck = True

	else:

	letterCheck = False


	## check for numbers

	numberCheck = False

	numCheck = re.compile('[\d+]')

	if(numCheck.search(enteredPassword)):

	numberCheck = True

	else:

	numberCheck = False




	## check for special characters

	specialCharacterCheck = False

	specialCheck = re.compile('[!@#$%^&*~]')

	if(specialCheck.search(enteredPassword)):

	specialCharacterCheck = True

	else:

	specialCharacterCheck = False

	print(lengthCheck, letterCheck, numberCheck, specialCharacterCheck)


	##Check if password meets requirements. 

	if(lengthCheck and letterCheck and numberCheck and specialCharacterCheck):

	return True

	else:

	return False


	## Get Password

	password = input("Enter Password: ")

	if(isValidPassword(password)):

	print("Password Valid")

	else:

	print("Password Failed")


### Day 61: Dec. 7, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           I worked a little Regex in JavaScript 
**Thoughts**
	Today I was really busy, so honestly I didn’t get much coding in I forced myself to do about 20 minutes of code today. It was on the Regex section of Free Code Camp. 

### Day 62: Dec. 8, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Today I spent a lot of time on Regex in JavaScript, and finished the #FreeCodeCamp section on it. 
**Thoughts**
		Today I made up for how little time I spent coding. I probably spent 2-4 hours on just one of the problems trying to figure out how to reuse patterns with regex on one of the Free Code Camp questions. I sadly have to admit I had to use hints (Which to me is basically cheating, so cheat) to figure this out. I am not sure why I couldn’t figure out the right direction or what it was asking me to do. Anyhow the link to the question and my solution is below.
		The good news is by spending so much time on that regex question, I think I learned a ton on Regular Expressions, being I spent tons of time trying different regex variations and what they do. So I have to say I definitely learned a lot. Thank you regex101.com you’re a great resource.

### Day 63: Dec. 9, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Today I did the @freeCodeCamp debugging section.
**Thoughts**
		Today I was super down, for numerous reasons. Anyhow I was able at the end of the day to put that aside and power through the debugging section of Free Code Camp. 

###Day 64: Dec. 10, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Today I started the Free Code Camp Basic Data Structures section.
**Thoughts**
                        I wish I knew how many times I actually went over certain coding concepts. Part of me knows I’ve done a lot of the Free Code Camp problems previously, yet they still feel unfamiliar, yet familiar at the same time. The problems are getting more interesting and fun.
                       I am excited and looking forward to getting to the project section of the “JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification”. Lastly I am happy to keep a flow going. Oh yeah yesterday I forgot to mention I started applying for summer internships, I am really hoping someone takes a chance on me and realizes it was a great choice.



###Day 65: Dec. 11, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Working hard through the Free Code Camp Basic Data Structures section.
**Thoughts**
                        I have been coding for more than an hour a day currently on the Data Structures section @freecodecamp. It has been great though, they are tougher questions and you really feel like you worked hard to get to your solution and feel a sense of accomplishment. I hope to keep the momentum going, I do see the uphill battle in view for the coming soon sections.    



### Day 66: Dec. 12, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
           Today I finished the #FreeCodeCamp “Basic Data Structures” and started the “Basic Algorithm Scripting”
**Thoughts**
		I can’t quite get rid of the butterflies in my stomach, every time I approach a new problem. I do have more confidence then I use to and I know how to get to the end solution, but shaking that feeling of the possibility of failure, sure feels improbable. So on that note…  
I need to stop worrying about sprinting and just walking and enjoy the moment. I believe the main reason for the butterflies is I just want to know I am good enough for a work place or anything and I am too scared to fail. 

### Day 67: Dec. 13, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

           Today I worked on the Basic Algorithm Scripting section in #FreeCodeCamp. I am exactly half way through that section. 

**Thoughts**

                        Everything went good in coding. Although on the Free Code Camp question of “Basic Algorithm Scripting: Truncate a String”. I solved the answer, but it was kind of accidental, because I was trying to see why my original code wasn’t working. I have a feeling I am not reading the question right (Which is below). So what I kept thinking on my if statement was if(str.length >= num), but then I just made it less than or equal (<=) to try it out. And behold it past there tests. Something about the sentence structure must be throwing me off. It’s kind of late, so I am going to review it tomorrow anyhow.

Question:

Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ...ending.

Solution:

				function truncateString(str, num) {  // Clear out that junk in your trunk



				  if(str.length <= num){

				    console.log(str.length)

				    return str;

				 }  

				//get the part of the string needed with slice function, up to the number in argument

				 let stringName = str.slice(0,num);  

				 stringName += "...";   

				 return stringName;

				}



				 truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", 8);

### Day 68: Dec. 14, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      Today I worked on more of the Basic Algorithm Scripting section in #FreeCodeCamp. I am 2/3 of the way through. 
**Thoughts**
		Everything has been going surprisingly well lately, in all of the coding challenges. I hope the momentum keeps going. 





### Day 69: Dec. 15, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      Today I worked on more Basic Algorithm Scripting from #FreeCodeCamp. I have 2 more questions left. The last few problems keep throwing me off with little nuances.   
**Thoughts**
		Everything is going okay, I am excited to finish up tomorrow, this Algorithm section. These last 4 questions or so have been taking me probably around an hour each. Between just understanding the little nuances that can come up to solve each problem. And me reading up on methods from the MDN(Mozilla Developers Network), and getting to know and understand them. On another note the MDN is now my best friend. 


### Day 70: Dec. 16, Sunday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

                      Today I finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting from #FreeCodeCamp. On to the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) section.

**Thoughts**

                        I find it funny when my solutions are different then the Free Code Camp ones. I know they don’t mind, but I still have to wonder why it bothers me if I don’t have the same solution as them. I guess that is what coding is all about, tons of ways to solve a problem :).  


### Day 71: Dec. 17, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      Today I started working on the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) section of #FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts**
		Looking at OOP through the eyes of JavaScript, is always an adjustment. Especially after learning Java OOP. They are similar in concepts, yet feel so different. Anyhow with each section I get through on #FCC I am more excited to keep moving on and get to real projects again. They feel so close, yet so far away.  



### Day 72: Dec. 18, Tuesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

                      Today I finished the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) section of #FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**

                   I had to force myself to code today. I really wasn't in the mood to code. I am Happy I got through it though.



### Day 73: Dec. 19, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

I started working on the “Functional Programming” section today from #FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**

…


### Day 74: Dec. 20, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      I am working on more of the “Functional Programming” section from #FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts**
                   …It is getting rough out in the world these days and it makes it hard to concentrate. 


### Day 75: Dec. 21, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      Same things different day, working on more of the “Functional Programming” section from #FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts**
                   I really wish this only thing on my mind was learning to code or I should say just coding. I honestly think I know how to code, although I am learning new concepts in coding. So maybe it’s just learning new coding concepts I should be saying. Hmm…
 

### Day 76: Dec. 22, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                      I am closing up on finishing out the “Functional Programming” #FreeCodeCamp section.  I am closing in on finishing out the “Functional Programming” #FreeCodeCamp section. I only have a few questions left.
**Thoughts**
                   I happen to really like this functional programming section in Free Code Camp, since it has been allowing me to work a lot of with JSON and array manipulations. I hope to be done in the next day or two. It depends how long each questions will take some are a breeze some take 30 minutes. So we will see.  
 

### Day 77: Dec. 23, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                       I am still finishing up on the “Functional Programming” section on #FreeCodeCamp. I keep getting caught up on the regex delimiters I need to use amongst a few other problems I am not fluent in yet.
**Thoughts**
	It is hard to get fluent/familiar with certain tools, like REGEX or certain methods. I understand them, but I do have to keep going back to resources such as the MDN and blogs to refresh my memory often. I know what I need to use which I think is half the battle, but I am not building anything enough to keep it fluent yet. 
                    


### Day 78: Dec. 24, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
                       Today I finished the “Functional Programming” section on #FreeCodeCamp. I also started the “Intermediate Algorithm” section. 
**Thoughts**
	Well as usual on the first algorithm question, my approach is different than the provided solutions. Technically they are the same in thought process and concept to a solution, but I didn’t use the Math class. Anyhow onwards I go.
                    


### Day 79: Dec. 25, Tuesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

I am working through the advanced “Intermediate Algorithm” section on #FCC. I did get stuck on the “Seek and Destroy” problem.

**Thoughts**

I had to stop coding in the middle of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Seek and Destroy question. This isn’t something I like to do, but I don’t have much time to code currently, being I am on vacation. I did look at the hints and am reading a little more on how arguments work in JavaScript. It looks like it kind of takes all items passed through the one parameter as one whole unit. Pretty interesting, so I was reading up on how that works. Then I will most likely split it up and compare, but for now I am just learning more about how arguments work in JavaScript and the .call function.


### Day 80: Dec. 26, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**

Working on the “Wherefore art thou” algorithm on #FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**

The algorithm questions have definitely ramped up in difficulty, so they are taking me a little longer to get through.



### Day 81: Dec. 27, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**

           
At this point I barely got in 40 minutes. I am still working on the “Wherefore art thou” algorithm. I wanted to get the write up out of the way. Though I will get at least 20 more minutes in before sleep, or more.


**Thoughts**

        
I am exhausted, I am trying to do way too many things these days. Next week it should calm down a little and allow me more time and focus to code.


### Day 82: Dec. 28, Friday 2018

**Today’s Progress**

I am still working on the “Wherefore art thou” algorithm. *SIGH*

**Thoughts**

It’s not going well.



### Day 83: Dec. 29, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**
                       I spent plenty of hours on the “Wherefore art thou” algorithm. I finally solved it with help from a member of the Discord coding community. 

**Thoughts**
	After spending so much time on the Algorithm question for “Wherefore art thou”, I should of just solved it the way I knew how. Which ended up being the way I solved the question anyhow with, since I had reassurance it was the correct way to approach the problem. Which incorporated flags for my answer (my answer is below). 

	Before answering the question I spent numerous hours of my time trying to force in using the .filter method to no avail. Since I believe it is the way #FCC, was expecting me to answer it with, but in the end I came up with I just don’t understand callbacks enough and how these functions are all working together. That is why I am going to try and focus on understanding callbacks and these .map, .filter, .reduce functions, for the next day.  

*Impostor Syndrome is in full effect, I don’t feel smart enough at all for programming, and I’m really starting to think I am making a huge mistake in pursuing programming. Things are starting to get really tough with trying to remember and understand what each function does and how they all work together to get the results I need. I know what I need to do to solve a problem, but getting it written in computer language is much easier said than done. 

**Answer to Wherefore art thou**
		function whatIsInAName(collection, source) {
		  // What's in a name?
		//Hold new collection of objects.
		  var arr = [];
		  // Loop through the collection to grab an object. 
		// from the source get the keys that are required to be in the object
		//use a flag to make sure it has all the keys and values pair equivalence matched
		for (let i=0; i<collection.length;i++) {
		  let item = collection[i];
		  let sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);
		 let hasAllKeys = true;
		//nested loop to go through the source keys and check the collection item/object if it doesn’t equal source, thus requirements aren’t met 			and hasAllKeys = false;
		  for(let j = 0; j < sourceKeys.length; j++){
		    if(item[sourceKeys[j]] != source[sourceKeys[j]]){
			 hasAllKeys = false;
		    }
		  }
		//if hasAllKeys push the item/object to the array.
		if(hasAllKeys){
		  arr.push(item);
		}
		}
		  // Only change code above this line
		  return arr;
		}


### Day 84: Dec. 30, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**
                       I did more research on callbacks, I solved the “wherefore art thou” using the filter method. I started working on the “Spinal Tap Case”. I Just need to tweak it a little, well really find the regex to allow me to work with a range of a capital letter to another letter. The regex for spaces and dashes was the easy part.  
**Thoughts**
	I am better today, but I am starting to get bored of working on just algorithms questions and no other coding projects. 


### Day 85: Dec. 31, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**
                Today I finished the #FCC Spinal Tap Algorithm (solution on blog). I also started working on a new side project.          
**Thoughts**
	I finished up the algorithms for the Spinal Tap case. It had its difficulties finding the correct way to write my regex, it wasn’t too bad. The hardest part was just figuring out how to right the Regex to have it do what I wanted it to.  The solution is below. 
	I also started working on a new personal project code named ”Project Papyrus” for now, since I wanted to be working on something that wasn’t just algorithms all the time. So I decided to split my time between my own project and the advanced algorithm questions on Free Code Camp. This way I have something that feels more exciting to work on.  

**Link**
[FCC question] https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/spinal-tap-case

**Solution**
		function spinalCase(str) {
		  // "It's such a fine line between stupid, and clever."
		  // --David St. Hubbins

		// split string into array, either by capital or underscore or space
		let re = /(?=[A-Z])|[\_\s]/;
		//Make array with regex split
		let matchesArray = str.split(re);
		//join to make a string
		let stringTest = matchesArray.join("-").toLowerCase();

		console.log("Array: " + matchesArray);
		console.log(stringTest);

		  return stringTest;
		}

		spinalCase('This IsSpinal_tap');

		/* make regex expression that checks for space and _ in string
		replace with -
		 */

### Day 86: Jan. 1, Tuesday 2019

**Today’s Progress**

               Happy New Year! Got a couple of algorithms done on #FCC. Doing more research and planning my approach for my side project as well.

**Thoughts**

      I was happy to be able to get through 2 algorithms today, pretty simply. Below is my “Pig Latin” solution since it seemed like the only solution Free Code Camp didn’t have. I also started mapping out more of a plan for my side project. I started checking out some APIs for it that I will need. I also plan on going through some API tutorials, since it has been a while since I touched one. I think I found a pretty straight forward refresher tutorial, which I posted a link to below.



**Links**



[API Tutorial]: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/





**Solution**

		function translatePigLatin(str) {

		  //list of vowels

		  var vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"];

		  //if first letter a vowel return string with "way" on the end.

		  if(vowels.includes(str[0])){

		    return str+="way";



		  }



		  else{

		    //find next vowel using regex

		    let re = /(?=[aeiou])(.+)/;



		    //split at vowel position and make a new array

		    let splitString = str.split(re);

		   

		    // create a new array with the correct order of the 2 elements.

		    let newArray = swapArrayElements(splitString,0,1);



		    //push the "ay" on the end of the new array to make the pig latin.

		    newArray.push("ay");

		    //join the array together to make the piglatin word.

		    let pigLatin = newArray.join("");

		   

		    return pigLatin;



		  }





		}



		//function to swap array elements

		var swapArrayElements = function(arr, indexA, indexB){

		  var temp = arr[indexA];

		  arr[indexA] = arr[indexB];

		  arr[indexB] = temp;

		  return arr;

		};



		console.log(translatePigLatin("consonant"));



### Day 87: Jan. 2, Wednesday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               I worked through an API tutorial. After that I worked on adding what I learned, into my personal project. Messed around with flexbox and DOM manipulation. 
**Thoughts**
	I am trying to learn how to work with themoviedb.org API. It has a lot of things going on and not even close to as straight forward to the tutorial I did, but that is what happens in the real world. Anyhow on a side note, I am pretty frustrated today with the outside sources of life. I did probably code most of my day though.  Tomorrow I plan on doing an algorithm challenge on free code camp, since I never got to one today. Then I will work on trying to get the API connected how I want as well. 


### Day 88: Jan. 3, Thursday 2019

**Today’s Progress**

Today I worked on the “CSS Selectors” section on #TeamTreeHouse. I did a couple of algorithm challenges on #FCC and I worked on understanding AJAX with APIs more.

**Thoughts**

I had a lot of trouble understanding how to connect with AJAX and the movie API I was working with, to get the objects I wanted. So after a while messing with that I started to bring myself back to reality and reading more of the basics on it and not getting to ahead of myself with it. After that I started to get back on track with the front end course on Team Tree House, since I only have a section or two before the Ajax introduction. So I figured I should start from the basics and teach myself from there. Lastly I did a couple more algorithm challenges today.


### Day 89: Jan. 4, Friday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished part 1 of the “CSS Selectors” section on #TeamTreeHouse. I also did a couple of algorithm challenges on #FCC.
**Thoughts**
	Not much to say. 

  


### Day 90: Jan. 5, Saturday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I worked on a #FCC algorithm. That for some reason caused me pain for no reason. 
**Thoughts**
	For some reason todays algorithm, triggered bad habits in me and took me way longer then I wanted. I had to step away because my brain wasn’t processing what it needed to do correctly. Though after I relaxed and took a break I came back and solved it pretty fast and simply. 
Something about any mathematical problem that has a math term associated with it, somehow always psyches me out. I think I have some type of PTSD associated with math formulas. I am glad I was able to take a step back though in the end and solve it without any issues. My solution is below. 
**Links**
	[Fibonacci Question] - https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers.
**Solution**

		function sumFibs(num) {

		 let prevNum = 1;
		 let nextNum = 0;
		 let sum = 0;

		 for(let i = 0; i < num; i++){
		   let temp = prevNum + nextNum;
		   prevNum = nextNum;
		   nextNum = temp;
		   console.log(temp)
		  if (temp % 2 !== 0 && temp <= num){
		    sum += temp;
		  }
		  console.log("sum: " + sum);
		 }

		  return sum;
		}

		sumFibs(75025);

		//
		 //start the prev num at 1
		//  let prevNum = 1;
		//start next num at 0;
		//  let nextNum = 0;
		//sum for all the return value 0
		//  let sum = 0;
		//loop through the num given 
		//  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
		  //make a temp variable to hold the next number this way we can set the previous number correctly
		//    let temp = prevNum + nextNum;
		// set the previous num to what is the current next number
		//    prevNum = nextNum;
		//set next number to the new number which is in temp.
		//    nextNum = temp;
		//    console.log(temp)
		// check if the current temp # meets the condtion of being odd and less then given integer. If it is add to sum.
		//   if (temp % 2 !== 0 && temp <= 10){
		//     sum += temp;
		//   }
		//   console.log("sum: " + sum);
		//  }


### Day 91: Jan. 6, Sunday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I worked on another #FCC algorithm. I also finished up another section of the CSS Selectors section on #TeamTreeHouse.  
**Thoughts**
	I have less than 10 algorithms left on FCC advanced algorithm section to complete. And one section left of the “CSS selectors” course on Team Tree House. Today I did have to cheat a little, I used a formula for prime numbers that wasn’t mine. Mainly because I made an algorithm to find prime numbers, but it wasn’t efficient enough for the FCC question. So the FCC hints even said you may need to use someone else’s prime function. So instead of going crazy and killing myself I did just that. 


### Day 92: Jan. 7, Monday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished the CSS Selectors course on #TeamTreeHouse.  
**Thoughts**
	I really wanted to work on one of the algorithms from Free Code Camp today. Though when I looked at the next question, my brain just was in another zone today. It wouldn’t let me processes it and do it. So I decided I would wait it out and attempt it tomorrow.  
The deeper the math algorithms get, the harder it gets for me to do them. Thankfully I am almost done with this section. Honestly I understand a good puzzle and how to solve one, but I really don’t understand what it is asking me to do completely in these questions sometimes. 
 My first task and usually the longest part to solve some of these problems is just deciphering what I am actually trying to accomplish. This is probably the saddest and loneliest part of coding to me, because I just don’t feel smart enough, when it comes to math problems.
 Even if I study it nonstop I still have a hard time with them or maybe I don’t and it’s just a confidence thing, maybe its normal how I feel on them. I really wouldn’t know, what is typical, or how long people take on each question.
 Either way I am sure I will figure it out, I just have to relearn some math before I can solve the question and be in a better headspace. Life besides coding is taking a little bit of a toll on me right now, more than I would like, and the number one thing in coding to me is just thinking slow and clear.   

### Day 94: Jan. 9, Wednesday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished the #FCC Algorithm for the “Smallest Common Multiple” in a range challenge. It was really hard to figure out and is still confusing what is actually happening even after the fact I’ve solved it. 
**Thoughts**
	I feel really weird, I solved the problem knowing what needed to be done, but I am not actually sure what the code is doing. Mainly what doesn’t make sense, which I am still trying to understand, is the steps each number in range is taking to compare itself to one another. I am continuing to do research though to try and understand it better. I feel like a cheat completely right now. Being if it wasn’t for the help of others I wouldn’t have solved this problem. Solution below. 
**Solution**

		function smallestCommons(arr) {

		  //Make array of arguments. I don't know why the argument split to array wasn't converting it into an array. So I had to use this method.
		  let args = [arr[1],arr[0]];

		//Sort the numbers from high to low. 
		 args.sort(function (a,b){
		   return b-a;
		 })

		//make a new array of numbers in range. 
		let arrSorted = [];

		for(let i = args[0]; i >= args[1]; i--){
		  arrSorted.push(i);
		}

		 //reduced this part is throwing me off, I won’t try to explain it, until I can. 
		  let test = arrSorted.reduce((x,y) => 
		    leastCommonMultiple(x,y));

		  return test;

		}

		smallestCommons([1,3]);

		//euclidean function to find the GCD
		function euclideanGCD(a,b){

		if (a == 0 && b != 0){
		  return b;
		} 

		if (b == 0 && a != 0){
		  return a;
		} 

		if(a > b){
		   return euclideanGCD(a % b, b);

		} else{
		    return euclideanGCD(b % a, a);
		}

		}

		//function to find lcd. 
		function leastCommonMultiple(a,b){
		  return a*b/euclideanGCD(a,b);
		}




## Day 95: Jan. 10, Thursday 2019

**Today’s Progress**

               Today I finished the #FCC Algorithm for the “Drop It” and started the “Steam Roller” one. I am pretty sure I solved the steam roller one, which is just nested array into a single one. Though it didn’t like my answer, so I need to come up with a different solution.  I also started to go over #jQuery at #TeamTreeHouse.

**Thoughts*

            I think the steam roller question failed, because it just wanted more of an algorithm answer broken down and not just me using a function, that does all the work.


## Day 96: Jan. 11, Friday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished the #FCC Algorithm for “Steam Roller” and moved along to “Binary Agents”. 
**Thoughts*
	Not much else to say. 

**Solution**

		function steamrollArray(arr) {
		  // I'm a steamroller, baby

		  function flatten(arr){
		    arr.forEach(function (element){
			 if(Array.isArray(element)){
			   flatten(element);
			 }else{
			   newArr.push(element);
			 }
		    });
		  }

		 const stack = [...arr];
		 const newArr = [];
		 flatten(stack)
		console.log(newArr);

		 
		return newArr;
		}

		console.log(steamrollArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]));



## Day 97: Jan. 12, Saturday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished the #FCC Algorithm for “Binary Agents” and “Everything Be True”. Only 3 more Algorithms left to do and 3 days left of #100DaysOfCode :). I also did some jQuery work on #TeamTreeHouse.
**Thoughts*
	I solved the “binary agent” algorithm twice, once when I was going through a bunch of thoughts on how to convert binary to decimal. Then once I looked at the solutions, I saw they used parseInt, I didn’t realize that parseInt can convert to base 2 or anything I wanted. So I went back and did it again. Below are those 2 solutions.  

**Soultion**

		function binaryAgent(str) {
		  //split word
		  let arrWords = str.split(' '); 
		  //create array to hold letters
		  let newLetterArr = [];

		//convert binary to decimal 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
		//loop through each binary code in the array
		for(let i = 0; i < arrWords.length; i++){
		  //holder of decimal total.
		  let decimalTotal = 0;
		//loop through each base number and give it a value
		for(let j = 0; j < 8; j++){
		//find base then if base has a 1 then add to decimal total.
		    switch (j){
			 case 0:
			 if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal = 128;
			 }
			   break;
			 case 1:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 64;
			   }
			   break;
			 case 2:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 32;
			   }
			   break;
			 case 3:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 16;
			   }
			   break;
			 case 4:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 8;
			   }
			   break;
			 case 5:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 4;
			   }
			   break;
			 case 6:
				if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 2;
				}
			   break;
			 case 7:
			   if(arrWords[i][j] == 1){
			   decimalTotal += 1;
			   }
			   break;
			   
		    }
		  

		}
		//convert decimal number into string letter. Then join it to array. 
		  newLetterArr.push(String.fromCharCode(decimalTotal));

		}
		//return sentence string joined together from array.
		  return newLetterArr.join('');

		}

		binaryAgent("01000001 01110010 01100101 01101110 00100111 01110100 00100000 01100010 01101111 01101110 01100110 01101001 01110010 01100101 01110011 00100000 01100110 01110101 01101110 00100001 00111111");

		Solution 2 for Binary Agent.

		function binaryAgent(str) {
		  //split binary letters.
		  let splitBinary = str.split(" ");
		  //use to hold letters.
		  let wordsArr = [];
		  
		  //loop through binary array
		  for(let i = 0; i < splitBinary.length; i++){
		    //parse the binary numbers using base 2.
		    var parsed = parseInt(splitBinary[i],2);
		    console.log(parsed);
		    // convert the char decimal number to a letter.
		    wordsArr.push(String.fromCharCode(parsed));
		  }
		  //return joined letters
		  return wordsArr.join('');
		}

		binaryAgent("01000001 01110010 01100101 01101110 00100111 01110100 00100000 01100010 01101111 01101110 01100110 01101001 01110010 01100101 01110011 00100000 01100110 01110101 01101110 00100001 00111111");





		 

## Day 98: Jan. 13, Sunday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I finished the #FreeCodeCamp Algorithm for “Arguments Optional”.
**Thoughts**
	Solution below for my algorithm. 
**Solution**

		function addTogether(x) {
		//split arguments into array
		var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

		// let x = args[0]; only if free code camp wants no paremeters. 

		//check if the argument has a length of 2 and the 2nd argument is a number. Technically I know the test subject is only passing non numbers to the 2nd place. So I can also add another && to make 		sure argument 0 also is a number. 
		if(args.length == 2 && typeof args[1] == "number"){
		  return args[0] + args[1];

		//if not 2 numbers check if it's only 1 argument then use a curried function to return function.
		} else if(args.length == 1 && typeof args[0] == "number"){

		    return function (y){
			 //if 2nd argumen is a number return the sum. Else return undefined. 
			 if(typeof y == "number"){
			   return  x + y;
			 }
			 else return undefined;
		  }
		} else{
		  return undefined;
		}

		}
		  

		addTogether(2)([3]);




## Day 99: Jan. 14, Monday 2019
**Today’s Progress**
               Today I worked on jQuery on #TeamTreeHouse, I also finished another algorithm on #FreeCodeCamp. One more algorithm to go, then it’s on to the #FCC projects. 
**Thoughts**
	I am looking forward to finishing up the TeamTreeHouse.com jQuery section tomorrow, as well as finishing the Free Code Camp “Advanced Algorithms” section.

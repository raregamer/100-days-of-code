### Day 1: October 08, Monday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Took a refresher in git so I can push this very fork. Worked on my school coding homework (A product calculator), which I did in Java. Lastly got my WordPress Blog up and running.  
**Thoughts** I have been coding for a year and a half, but something still fills missing. I started 100 days of code to be my sort of pseudo blog to look back on. I hope these anxious feelings of my future subsides. My homework took about 2 hours to complete for the pseudo code and writing Java code, is that normal? I am always wondering if I am being efficient. It has been a little while since I wrote Java code so had to refresh my memory a little on that as well.

### Day 2: October 09, Tuesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting better at css positioning (Absolutes and Relative), I made a Flow Chart. Learned AWS for hosting a static coming soon landing page (JewishDecorating.com), which I also completed today.  
**Thoughts** I am super glad to finally have actually built a project that wasn’t hosted on Codepen or Github through AWS. I am still having trouble with subdomain on aws though I hope to clear up by the end of “my night” (It is super weird that I can’t get the www.jewishdecorating.com to work, but JewishDecorating.com works*SIGH*). I got to work on TeamTreeHouse for positioning and then made some of my own tests to reinforce it. It was the first time I feel like I understand a good degree of positioning and how much help a position relative wrapper, with an absolute element can be so fun and interesting to work with. I need to get better at writing pseudo code (for Java) and conceptualizing layouts.

### Day 3: October 10, Wednesday 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked on more Html/CSS. Started a new website project (a movie fan page) to practice on for the next couple of days or weeks (who knows “If I use it I won’t lose it right? “). I revisited positioning on TeamTreeHouse. Lastly worked on Java pseudo code writing.  
**Thoughts** I am purposely taking my time on html and css. All my responsive page projects on Free Code Camp are done, but I don’t quite want to move ahead yet. I Started a new website project (a movie fan page). Thinking about when I want to start using and learning JavaScript again. I just don’t want to rush anything. I am really taking my time and trying to slow my brain down. I also started writing extra detailed pseudo code to help me think through things before I jump into coding (Mainly on my java school work). I wish I knew what “job ready” really means. Will I ever not feel nervous before I start a project? I always think I am doing it wrong, I keep doubting everything wondering if I am using the best practices. I just don’t want to make bad habits. I wonder if it’s normal if I am always nervous before I put a div down, or maybe it should be a span, maybe it doesn’t need either?!?:/(confusion I call this). I think I will start responsive layouts team tree house, tomorrow.


### Day 4: October 11, Thursday 2018

**Today's Progress**: I Worked on my new movie fan page, lots of hours trying to center an image with the nav bar text to be centered (without flex or grid), is this normal?.

**Thoughts** It was a really tough day. I thought I knew enough to control my css positioning elements, but I just couldn’t get the nav bar and logo image aligned correctly on a header. I tried many different solutions, but nothing was working properly. It was a very discouraging day honestly. I keep getting stuck in positioning things with css and also being responsive. So instead of moving on today I continued my work with positioning. I am continuing to keep working on it until I really can get things working to have the most responsive layouts, with the most basic css code. I could of used flex, but I really wanted to solve it a different way.  I want to truly understand why and when positions work the way that they do, and fully be able to explain it well to others. For now I ended up just using absolute positioning, I am sure there is probably a better way to do it. I think it has something to do with vertical align middle, but it just wasn’t working for me. Feel free to take a look at the code below and find a better solution without flexbox or grids.

### Day 5: October 12, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: I Worked on my movie fan page some more(sneak peak image on blog). Worked on making a footer stick to the bottom of the screen mainly today.
**Thoughts** It was a little of a battle getting the footer to stick to the bottom of the page properly, without being fixed all the time. The article below helped me out to understand better. I did handle the battle today, better then yesterday. I contribute that to wanting to cook for the Sabbath. I will tweak more of this fan site design, and decide if I want to go into JavaScript yet. I might do one or two more html/css projects. While writing this I do think I might just stick with another week of just html/css properties. I do believe I am getting familiar with it and I want to keep it that way.

### Day 6: October 13, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**: Today I worked mainly on my coding HW(I paid extra attention to my pseudo code). I also went to a coding meetup. Maybe got 30 min of CSS done as well.  

**Thoughts** I felt good about going to the meetup today. Seeing peoples work and just being around like minded people is really helpful mentally.  I am super happy to also say goodbye to the Raptor program school was having us use to code, and we can start using Python.  Today I also was reminiscing and sad that I kind of gave up on my Android development, months ago in favor of web development, being the probability of an entry level job is more likely with web development. **I wonder if I should try to code a small project in it again? Hmm I might have to let this one go for now and not take on any more things though. ** Time to start Python coding.

### Day 7: October 14, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today I put a lot of hours into more CSS positioning which was a failure, although I don’t say this ever a “successful failure”. I still think I might just stick with CSS for a week more before I move on to new things, other than school Python work.
**Thoughts** I got to have some good conversations on Discord about some absolute positioning rules, and other little bits of information in the coding world.  It was good to see I am not the only one taking 4 hours to figure out how to make a certain positioning work even for professionals. We pretty much came to a result of absolute positioning is just not going to work in some type of container to center it, without manually setting margins or widths. Especially to be responsive as well.  You can see my “absolute failure” NOT centered in the black below. I do think I got a way better idea of absolute positioning and its limitations. There is still much to learn on it, but I think I will move on from trying to force it to center 8 absolute items in a wrapper and thinking it will come out pretty.

### Day 8: October 15, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today was all about making a new page layout. I wanted to use only floats to make the grid. Thankfully it actually did work. I was also able to make it responsive with flex fairly simply (for a change)!
**Thoughts**  Today was a nice change, being I was able to implement a grid way easier than I thought it would be, using only floats. I had a couple of small issues (Which is totally normal and expected), but I was able to fix them pretty easily by myself. I thought I was going to just cave in and end up using a css grid, since I had so much trouble with the banner (on the American Pie home page) with absolute values. Though the floats worked the way I expected them to, getting centered and being responsive with flex. On a side note my regards to Paul Allen today. It is always sad to hear about and see the people that inspired me and gave me a sense of curiosity to do more pass away.

### Day 9: October 16, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**: Today I worked on making my movie trailer page, which worked out well. I also started to introduce myself to Python and in school we started using and coding with it as well. I do prefer Java as of now, since that is what I originally learned how to code with.
**Thoughts** Today was pretty basic as far as things, watched the Derek Bananas video for Python. I worked on my American Pie movie trailer page. Not too much to report I wish I would have coded more today, but I had a lot of extra things to do today and I think I need some goodnight sleep. 

### Day 10: October 17, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Really tough, python killed me, really my hw more so. Python just is weird the way they don’t have brackets. I spent 4 hours somehow on making a, which number is bigger (more info below).

**Thoughts**

How do you get better at pseudo code? It’s really killing me. I didn't realize how bad I thought in programming terms, until I started my college class. I can't seem to write proper pseudo code. The only way I know how to code is by coding, then whatever is broken fix it. I just somehow spent 4 hours on making a which number is bigger between 3 numbers, in python in various ways, because I never thought of the possibility of 2 of the 3 numbers being equal and 1 being greater or less than. I might understand programming, but I don't think like a programmer yet.


### Day 11: October 18, Thursday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	I took kind of a chill day today, since yesterday hurt so much. I did some python coding homework. I also finished some loose ends on my #freecodecamp curriculum to get my Responsive Web Design Certification. 

**Thoughts** 
	Thankfully my python homework didn’t hurt me today, but I definitely felt a lot of “Imposter Syndrome” I worked on the accessibility track on free code camp to finish out my Responsive Web Design certification. I for some reason just kind of skipped over it originally, so it has been on my to do list. Today was the perfect day for that because I wanted to work on some css and be directed with simple instructions.  

### Day 12: October 19, Friday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

I worked on my Python homework for about an hour and half. Python has not been fun to learn after learning Java. I didn’t have as much time today to code as I would’ve liked.

 

**Thoughts**

Python is getting to be a little strange. I am not sure I like how I declare variables. It is kind of like JavaScript to me. I had a lot of trouble today with checking if a value is an int and I am still working on understanding it.

### Day 13: October 20, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Started some more CSS responsive design with Team Tree House. Worked on finishing my Python homework.   



**Thoughts**

            I learned Python really likes try blocks for data type verification of user inputs. I spend 4 hours on a homework that I could of finished in 10 minutes if I didn't overthink the question/problem. I need to stop over thinking things which seems to be a constant in every aspect of my life. I have so much to learn, yet I always feel like the door is closing.

### Day 14: October 21, Sunday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            It was hard getting to code today, I was busy up until 10pm. I just got an hour in, I didn’t have a plan since I was so tired. I tried to make a quick layout in CSS mimicking a magazine layout article.    



**Thoughts**

            I did get my code to work in that short time and replicate the first section of the magazine I was trying to replicate, but boy was/is it messy. It was also not as simple as I thought in my mind.  I will continue on with this idea in the future of using magazine layouts as inspiration.  Why won’t coding sink in better???



### Day 15: October 22, Monday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            I went through and practiced responsive design more. Went through the Team Tree House responsive course, and re-wrote/made comments/studied all of their html and CSS code structure to get a better understanding of how they lay it all out.

**Thoughts**

            Practiced, read more code, practiced more code. Just code, code, code. I am hoping I am studying the right way. Tomorrow I am going to go over flexbox again.  I realized Team Tree House relies a bit more on normalize css then I thought, for some basic padding stuff. Overall it was nice to see how they go about it.   

**P.S.**

I assure you that footer works correctly and doesn't float the way it does in the image.

### Day 16: October 23, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I worked on CSS flexbox and Python challenges. I decided to go through the PracticePython.org exercises, I will try to do one a day depending on how involved each one might be.

**Thoughts** 
	I am considering doing a one off day, just to go through and peek back at Android Studios and see what I can refresh my brain in. I wonder how much I retained since the last time I even opened it. I am hoping by the end of the week to have done that. I am not sure how bad it is to keep switching between so many languages. Oh well, they all at least having coding in common :).

### Day 17: October 24, Wednesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today was pretty straight forward, I worked on CSS flexbox and Python challenge 2 from #practicepython.org

**Thoughts** 
	Today’s coding was pretty simple, since I was really familiar with most of the concepts prior to today. I did get a better understanding on the flexbox grow and basis properties which was nice.

### Day 18: October 25, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Today was straight forward, I finished the TeamTreeHouse CSS flexbox course and Python challenge 3 from #practicepython.

**Thoughts**

Today’s coding was pretty much the same as yesterday, more flexbox and a Python challenge. I finished all things flexbox on teamtreehouse and everywhere else at this point. So I really hope I understand it well.

### Day 19: October 26, Friday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I worked on some HTML/CSS Forms. I also had to skip my Python challenge, in favor/priority of Python school homework. 

**Thoughts** 
	Today was all good, I reviewed form properties in HTML and CSS. In Python I had to hold off on practicepython.org, while I did Python school work. Which might take up the next couple days. Overall I got at least an hour in, but I wish I had more time. Fridays are usually the toughest days to get code time in. 



### Day 20: October 27, Saturday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I finished the #TeamTreeHouse forms track. Today's thoughts on my site have way more info, if you want more of a write up :).

**Thoughts** 
	 Today I finished the Team Tree House forms track. I will continue to work with forms with my next step being using a back-end to actually send the information in the form to a server using Python. I didn’t do any Python coding today as of this writing sadly, but will do it again tomorrow or later in the night if I am up for it. I am starting to feel somewhat of a burnout to try and fit as much code as possible in a day. I have been hitting more than an hour of code a day, but sometime in a flow I don’t want to just switch, even though there is so much I want to get to. I do also need breaks and downtime as well, family time and normal human maintenance time. Anyhow #movingforward.


### Day 21: October 28, Sunday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I did 2 Python exercises from practicepython.org. I am struggling so much internally, #impostorsyndrome is possibly taking over me or coding is just getting really hard. 

**Thoughts** 
	Today was really hard for me to keep motivated to code, but I forced myself through it. I am hoping tomorrow goes better. I am going to start working on JavaScript again tomorrow. I hope to get more confidence in my coding. I believe internally I am struggling most with impostor syndrome and a lack of guidance right now of what I am really working towards or the technologies I need to accomplish it I want to do. I hope that in the future I can get this worked out and have some clarity. On a side note the link below is to a forum post, which was reminding me just how hard even when you have a lot of progress/work under your belt how hard getting a job later on can be.

### Day 22: October 29, Monday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
	Today I started JavaScript again, on #FreeCodeCamp, I also did my practice Python exercise 6. 

**Thoughts** 
	Really today was mainly getting reacquainted with the JavaScript syntax. I also did the practicepython.org exercise 6. I really hope in the near future to get real life experience in coding. Everything I do is all “fun and games”, but never seems practical in a work environment. I could be wrong since I haven’t been in one yet though.

### Day 23: October 30, Tuesday 2018
**Today’s Progress**:
            Worked through more of the JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp. I also did my practice Python exercise 7.
**Thoughts**
            My Python exercise was funny, I guess I should read more carefully. When it says “write the even elements in one line”, don’t be me :) and write:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
##get the even indices :)
evenList = a[::2]
print(evenList)
 
Instead write:
evenList = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0].
 
Free Code Camp JavaScript was straight forward.  I am sure I will be doing more coding later at school tonight, but I am getting this write up out of the way since tonight I am going to the Mike Shinoda concert!

### Day 24: October 31, Wednesday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Worked through more of the JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp. I am almost complete with it, should be done tomorrow with it and moving onto es6. I was a little under the weather, so it was hard getting anything done.

**Thoughts**

Today I am feeling pretty sick so I got some JavaScript in, but tomorrow hoping to be better to have more progress.




### Day 25: Nov 01, Thursday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Today I went through Objects in JavaScript. I am about done on the JavaScript portion on #FCC. I could have done more, but I wanted to sit with some of the concepts a little more, before moving on. Fast isn’t always best, I learnt the hard way.

**Thoughts**

            I thought I would have been done today, on the JavaScript portion of Free Code Camp, but I couldn’t get to it all. I can say with confidence tomorrow “it’s going down”. I am sad I haven’t done Python for two days in a row. It’s really hard getting to everything I want to get to and still have some down time. Today thankfully, I was feeling better from being sick yesterday, I should be fully recovered tomorrow.

I touched a little on JSON, going through properties and pulling them out. I want to get more confident in manipulating JSON data. Something about it always gives me a nervous feeling. It just gets so messy in the nest.


### Day 26: Nov 02, Friday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

Today I finished up the JavaScript section of #FreeCodeCamp , It took way longer then I wanted, and I struggled on certain challenges, but it’s all done now : ). Now it’s time to reinforce it and move on.

**Thoughts**

The JavaScript JSON challenges broke me a little today, I spent close to 2 hours on  the “Record Collection Challenge” and the “Profile Lookup”. They aren’t even hard questions, but I just get lost in either not having the correct syntax, to pull the data I want, or I am overlooking a simple statement, that was just placed too early in the code block. The latter hurts me the most, because it continues to show when I am coding I am not following my own written program correctly in my head, which I work so hard on and struggle with constantly.

### Day 27: Nov 03, Saturday 2018

**Today’s Progress**:

            Today I worked on my Python homework and I started to go over JavaScript concepts on #TeamTreeHouse.   

**Thoughts**

            Today, not too much to report, it was pretty much do a Python homework that added books over a period of days, that a user entered. In JavaScript, I did the Team Tree House lessons that went over JavaScript concepts using a small in browser game framework called Phaser. I did think it was a really cool way to introduce JavaScript or programming to anyone who would be starting out. It peaked my interest on the Phaser framework and I would love to use it in my own project in the future.
